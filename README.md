**Equip Recommended Gear** adds a button to your character pane that equips the highest item level gear for your class & spec. Inspired by the same feature available in **Final Fantasy XIV Online**.

**Features**
- Adds a button. When you click the button, it does the thing.
- Instead of the button, you can also set a keybind or use `EquipRecommendedGear:DoTheThing()`. Refer to the API.lua documentation for more information.

**Limitations**
- It will only consider soulbound items.
- It will only consider weapons suitable for your specialisation. (2-handed weapons for Survival Hunter, daggers for Assassination Rogues, etc.)
- It will only consider weapons with your primary stat (Agility, Intellect, Strength) on them.
- It will not check rings or trinkets for your primary stat.
- It will not check the secondary stats of any gear.
- It will not use weights of any kind. It just looks at the item level. Number go up, happy brain chemicals.

**Known bugs**
- Using the button shortly after loading into the game will not always work properly. Try again a few seconds later.
